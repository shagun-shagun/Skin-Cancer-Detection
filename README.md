I built a classification model in Python using machine learning to detect skin cancer types. The pipeline involved data preprocessing, augmentation, and feature extraction. I used CNN-based architecture for image classification and evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The system also suggests preventive measures and treatment options.
